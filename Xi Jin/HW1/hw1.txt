1) Consider the url http://canvas.utexas.edu
   Run following commands and observe the difference between their responses:
   - curl -v -X HEAD http://canvas.utexas.edu
   - curl -v -X HEAD http://canvas.utexas.edu -H "Pragma: no-cache" -H "Cache-Control: max-age=0, no-cache, must-revalidate"
   Experiment with different sites and try to find more sites for which you observe the caching behavior similar to the canvas site.

Here are the difference that I have found:

2) Run following commands and observe their effect on the response:
   - curl -v http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~devdatta/test-file.txt
   - curl -v http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~devdatta/test-file.txt -H "If-Modified-Since: Thu, 06 Sep 2018 18:30:45 GMT"
   - curl -v http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~devdatta/test-file.txt -H "If-Modified-Since: Thu, 06 Sep 2018 18:30:44 GMT"
   - curl -v http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~devdatta/test-file.txt -H "If-Modified-Since: Thu, 06 Sep 2018 18:30:43 GMT"
   - curl -v http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~devdatta/test-file.txt -H "If-None-Match: \"8-5753816d31e27\""
   - curl -v http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~devdatta/test-file.txt -H "If-Match: \"8-5753816d31e27\""

   - Reflect on how the response gets affected based on the values that you passed in for If-Modified-Since and
     If-Match, If-None-Match headers

     "If-Modified-Since": if modified, the serve will return a status code 200 and the content.
				    else, the server will return a status code 304 without content.

     "If-None-Match": if two Etag do not match, status code 200. And return the content
				else, status code 304(Not Modified)

     "If-Match": if Etag matches, status code 200. And return contents
			 else, status code 412(Precondition Failed).

   - Which of these headers are using Entity Tags and validators?
	"If-None-Match" and "If-Match"


3) What is the difference between Strong and Weak Entity tag validators?

   Strong validator corresponds to calculating the entity tag / signature on every change of the resource

   Weak validator corresponds to calculating the entity tag / signature on “major” changes to an entity

4) State true/false:

True??? - Entity tag validators are calculated by Proxy Servers

True - Entity tag validators are calculated by Origin Servers

False - Entity tag validators are calculated by User Agents


5) Find a site that sends back "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" response header.

   Calculate the size of the content by considering each chunk.


   Tally it with the size of the content by measuring it independently (using other means such as Unix word count (wc) command)

6) Interact with 5 different sites/urls of your choosing using either curl or other tools that we discussed in class.
   Make a histogram of response headers (how many sites included each header).
   - Which headers were sent by all sites? Which headers were unique to two or more sites?
   - Are there sites that don't adhere to HTTP protocol (either 1.0 or 1.1)?

7) Read about following headers from the RFCs:
   - Accept-Ranges, Range, Age, max-age, no-store, Server, Via

8) Try out all the programs from HTTP directory in:
   - https://github.com/devdattakulkarni/ModernWebApps

9) Read this paper (upto section 3.3):
   - "Key Differences between HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1" by Krishnamurthy, Mogul, Kristol
      "http://www.ra.ethz.ch/cdstore/www8/data/2136/pdf/pd1.pdf

   Based on the paper answer following questions:

   9.1) What is the purpose of the OPTIONS method in HTTP

        Allow the client to learn about the capabilities of a server without actually requesting a resource.

   9.2) Explain what is meant by "semantic transparency" with respect to HTTP requests.

	Return the exact same response as it would be returned by direct communication with the origin server.

   9.3) Consider that a client makes a resource request and
        the origin server sends the response with Expires header value set to
        Thu, 6 Sep 2018 14:08:31 GMT (assume that this is one hour later than when the request was made).
        Suppose that the proxy server is faster than origin server by 15 minutes. What
        problem will occur when a client requests the resource:
        - after 15 minutes
        - after 30 minutes
        - after 45 minutes
        - after one hour
        Assume that the client, server, and proxy server are using HTTP 1.0.
        Assume that when the client makes first request proxy server does not contain the required resource in its cache.
        Explain the reason of the problem.

    9.4) Consider following sequence of events:
         - Origin server updates a resource at  Thu, 6 Sep 2018 16:46:53:001
         - Proxy server requests the resource at Thu, 6 Sep 2018 16:46:53:200
         - Origin server updates the resource at Thu, 6 Sep 2018 16:46:53:500
         - Proxy server requests the resource at Thu, 6 Sep 2018 16:46:53:700

         Assuming that the origin server and the proxy server are using HTTP 1.0
         for communication, what problem if any will occur after the above
         sequence of events.
         Explain the reason of the problem.

    9.5) Explain the purpose of "Cache-Control" header in HTTP 1.1.



    9.6) What is one advantage of using the "If-None-Match" header over "If-Modified-Since" header
