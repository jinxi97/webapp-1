No due date

1. servlet-unit-test
   - Run unit tests defined in TestHelloServlet.java and TestCalculatorServiceImpl.java
     through Eclipse/IntelliJ

     Done.

   - Test "testdoGet4" in TestHelloServlet is currently failing.
     Figure out why and then fix appropriate code in HelloServlet so that the test passes.

     doGet4() does not handle the condition when parsedURLs is null.

   - Several tests in TestCalculatorServiceImpl are currently failing.
     Figure out why and then fix CalculatorServiceImpl to make these tests pass.

     Need to break after calculation.

   - Add tests for following scenarios to TestCalculatorServiceImpl:
     - Values=[1,2,3,4], Operator=add
     - Values=[1,2,3,4], Operator=subtract
     - Values=[1,2,3,4], Operator=multiply
     - Values=[1,2,3,4], Operator=divide
     - Values=[1], Operator=subtract
     - Values=[1], Operator=multiply
     - Values=[1], Operator=divide
     - Values=[0,0], Operator=add
     - Values=[0,0], Operator=subtract
     - Values=[0,0], Operator=multiply
     - Values=[0,1], Operator=divide
     - Values=[0,1], Operator=add
     - Values=[1,0], Operator=add
     - Values=[1,0], Operator=subtract
     - Values=[0,1], Operator=subtract
     - Values=[1,0], Operator=multiply
     - Values=[0,1], Operator=multiply

     Done.

2. mockito-example
   - Run unit tests defined in TestEmailController.java and TestEnglishEditorServiceImpl.java through
     Eclipse/IntelliJ

     Done.

   - Test "testGetGreetingNullAction" in TestEmailController from mockito-example is currently failing.
      Figure out why and then modify appropriate code in EmailController so that the test passes.

     If statement need another layer of parenthesis.

   - Test "testWithGhostObject" in TestEmailController from mockito-example is failing.
     Figure out what is causing the test to fail. What technique can you use to make this test pass?

     If you create the service inside the method, there is no way to mock it. It is better
     to use the class variable.

   - Write one or more unit tests similar to "testReadDataFromEavesdrop" test to test your assignment2 logic.

     Done.
