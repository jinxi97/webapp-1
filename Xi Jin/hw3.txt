1) Try out session-example, url-rewriting from  https://github.com/devdattakulkarni/ModernWebApps/tree/master/Servlets

2) Read Section 8 of https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265 and answer following questions:

   - Confidentiality in security means that an entity (server/process) is not allowed to read
     files/data of another entity. What is meant by the problem of weak confidentiality of Cookie mechanism
     with respect to service ports.
     Explain with an example.

   - Suppose that foo.example.com sets a Cookie using Set-Cookie header with domain attribute foo.example.com. 
     Suppose that bar.example.com is compromised and the attacker sets its own cookies on all the responses
     for bar.example.com with domain attribute bar.example.com.
     Consider following sequence of interactions:
     - User visits foo.example.com
     - User visits bar.example.com
     - User visits foo.example.com

     For each request, show which Cookie(s) browswer will include in the request. Will the compromised
     domains Cookies affect user interactions with the non-compromised domain? Why?


3) Consider that user agent and origin server are communicating over HTTP 1.0
   in which after each request-response interaction the connection is closed.
   For tracking multiple requests, someone comes up with a mechanism whereby server
   will send a unique value in response body and the client sends it back
   to the server with each request as a query parameter. Will this scheme work?
   Compare this approach with the approach that you used in assignment 1. Which approach is better?

4) Read Section 7.1 of https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265 and answer following question
   in your own words:

   - What are third-party cookies? How do they work?

   - Why are third-party cookies bad from the perspective of online privacy?
