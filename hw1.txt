1) Consider the url http://canvas.utexas.edu
   Run following commands and observe the difference between their responses:
   - curl -v -X HEAD http://canvas.utexas.edu
   - curl -v -X HEAD http://canvas.utexas.edu -H "Pragma: no-cache" -H "Cache-Control: max-age=0, no-cache, must-revalidate"
   Experiment with different sites and try to find more sites for which you observe the caching behavior similar to the canvas site.

2) Run following commands and observe their effect on the response:
   - curl -v http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~devdatta/test-file.txt
   - curl -v http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~devdatta/test-file.txt -H "If-Modified-Since: Thu, 06 Sep 2018 18:30:45 GMT"
   - curl -v http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~devdatta/test-file.txt -H "If-Modified-Since: Thu, 06 Sep 2018 18:30:44 GMT"
   - curl -v http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~devdatta/test-file.txt -H "If-Modified-Since: Thu, 06 Sep 2018 18:30:43 GMT"
   - curl -v http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~devdatta/test-file.txt -H "If-None-Match: \"8-5753816d31e27\""
   - curl -v http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~devdatta/test-file.txt -H "If-Match: \"8-5753816d31e27\""

   - Reflect on how the response gets affected based on the values that you passed in for If-Modified-Since and
     If-Match, If-None-Match headers

     If-Modified-Since past:
        < HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
        < Date: Tue, 16 Oct 2018 06:10:40 GMT
        < Server: Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)
        < ETag: "12-5753bbdb98c05"

        > If-Match: "8-5753816d31e27"
        >
        < HTTP/1.1 412 Precondition Failed

        < ETag: "12-5753bbdb98c05"

        > If-None-Match: "8-5753816d31e27"
        >
        < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        < Date: Tue, 16 Oct 2018 06:11:12 GMT

        < ETag: "12-5753bbdb98c05"


   - Which of these headers are using Entity Tags and validators?

    If-Match, If-None-Match

3) What is the difference between Strong and Weak Entity tag validators?

4) State true/false:
   F - Entity tag validators are calculated by Proxy Servers
   T - Entity tag validators are calculated by Origin Servers
   F - Entity tag validators are calculated by User Agents

5) Find a site that sends back "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" response header.
   Calculate the size of the content by considering each chunk.
   Tally it with the size of the content by measuring it independently (using other means such as Unix word count (wc) command)

6) Interact with 5 different sites/urls of your choosing using either curl or other tools that we discussed in class.
   Make a histogram of response headers (how many sites included each header).
   - Which headers were sent by all sites? Which headers were unique to two or more sites?
   - Are there sites that don't adhere to HTTP protocol (either 1.0 or 1.1)?

7) Read about following headers from the RFCs:
   - Accept-Ranges, Range, Age, max-age, no-store, Server, Via

8) Try out all the programs from HTTP directory in:
   - https://github.com/devdattakulkarni/ModernWebApps

9) Read this paper (upto section 3.3):
   - "Key Differences between HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1" by Krishnamurthy, Mogul, Kristol
      "http://www.ra.ethz.ch/cdstore/www8/data/2136/pdf/pd1.pdf

   Based on the paper answer following questions:

   9.1) What is the purpose of the OPTIONS method in HTTP

   The OPTIONS method represents a request for information about the communication
   options available on the request/response chain identified by the Request-URI.
   This method allows the client to determine the options and/or requirements associated
   with a resource, or the capabilities of a server, without implying a resource action
   or initiating a resource retrieval.

   9.2) Explain what is meant by "semantic transparency" with respect to HTTP requests.

    A cache behaves in a "semantically transparent" manner, with
    respect to a particular response, when its use affects neither the
    requesting client nor the origin server, except to improve
    performance. When a cache is semantically transparent, the client
    receives exactly the same response (except for hop-by-hop headers)
    that it would have received had its request been handled directly
    by the origin server.

    The Cache-Control header allows a client or server to transmit a variety of directives in either
    requests or responses. These directives typically override the default caching algorithms. As a general
    rule, if there is any apparent conflict between header values, the most restrictive interpretation
    is applied (that is, the one that is most likely to preserve semantic transparency).

   9.3) Consider that a client makes a resource request and
        the origin server sends the response with Expires header value set to
        Thu, 6 Sep 2018 14:08:31 GMT (assume that this is one hour later than when the request was made).
        Suppose that the proxy server is faster than origin server by 15 minutes. What
        problem will occur when a client requests the resource:
        - after 15 minutes
        - after 30 minutes
        - after 45 minutes
        - after one hour
        Assume that the client, server, and proxy server are using HTTP 1.0.
        Assume that when the client makes first request proxy server does not contain the required resource in its cache.
        Explain the reason of the problem.

    9.4) Consider following sequence of events:
         - Origin server updates a resource at  Thu, 6 Sep 2018 16:46:53:001
         - Proxy server requests the resource at Thu, 6 Sep 2018 16:46:53:200
         - Origin server updates the resource at Thu, 6 Sep 2018 16:46:53:500
         - Proxy server requests the resource at Thu, 6 Sep 2018 16:46:53:700

         Assuming that the origin server and the proxy server are using HTTP 1.0
         for communication, what problem if any will occur after the above
         sequence of events.
         Explain the reason of the problem.

    9.5) Explain the purpose of "Cache-Control" header in HTTP 1.1.

    The Cache-Control general-header field is used to specify directives that MUST be obeyed
    by all caching mechanisms along the request/response chain. The directives specify behavior
    intended to prevent caches from adversely interfering with the request or response. These
    directives typically override the default caching algorithms. Cache directives are unidirectional
    in that the presence of a directive in a request does not imply that the same directive is to
    be given in the response.

    9.6) What is one advantage of using the "If-None-Match" header over "If-Modified-Since" header

    Timestamp value used in Last-Modified/If-Modified-Since has limited precision - one second and that is
    simply not enough for fast changing content like, for instance, Web-chat application where more than
    one message could be posted at any given second. ETag/If-None-Match can help to solve that problem.
